in order to copy to the OS buffer, you need to have xclip installed, so:

apt install xclip



Copying:

    1. Either scroll with the mouse or enter   Ctrl+A-[   ( or more generally:  <tmux-binding>-[  ) to enter copy-mode.
    2. Then scroll, or navigate with Page-Up/Page-Down/Up/Down keys.
    3. When you find what you want to copy: either select it with the mouse or:
        3.1. Ctrl-Space to enter "highlight mode".
        3.2. Navigate with Up/Down/Left/Right/Page-Up/Page-Down keys to highlight a selection.
    4. Press Alt-w to copy and leave copy-mode.
