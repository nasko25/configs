## Description
These are some configs that I use. I know they are pretty basic, but it is easier for me now, when I set up a new Linux instance. I hope to add more cofig options as I learn more about the tools, and use them more.

## TODO
- Maybe add a bash script that auto installs the config files.
- Cite the third-party plugins.

## References
- The tmux config is almost entirely taken from [Oh-My-Tmux](https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux).
- The zsh config is almost entirely taken from [Oh-My-Zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh). The reason I included some of the folders from there is because some of the plugins I use, I have found elsewhere on github, but don't remember which.
