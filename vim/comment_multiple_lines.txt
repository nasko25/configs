How to comment out multiple lines with vim:

"
Put your cursor on the first '#' character, press Ctrl+V (or Ctrl+Q for gVim), and go down until the last commented line and press 'x', that will delete all the '#' characters vertically.

For commenting a block of text is almost the same:


1. First, go to the first line you want to comment, press Ctrl+V. This will put the editor in the VISUAL BLOCK mode.

2. Then using the arrow key and select until the last line

3. Now press Shift+I, which will put the editor in INSERT mode and then press '#'. This will add a hash to the first line.

4. Then press Esc (give it a second), and it will insert a '#' character on all other selected lines.


For the stripped-down version of vim shipped with debian/ubuntu by default, type : s/^/# in the third step instead (any remaining highlighting of the first character of each line can be removed with :nohl).
